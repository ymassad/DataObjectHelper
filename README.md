# DataObjectHelper

This extension makes it easier to create Match methods and the With methods for Data Objects.

For more information, read the Designing Data Objects in C# and F# article here: http://www.dotnetcurry.com/patterns-practices/1429/data-objects-csharp-fsharp

The extension (which is free) can be found in the visual studio marketplace here: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yacoubmassad.DataObjectHelperExtension

If you have Resharper, you may not see the "Create With Methods" and "Create Match Methods" code actions in the Visual Studio bulb because Resharper might have hidden them. You can configure Resharper to include Roslyn based code actions in their own bulb from the options:

It seems that in newer versions of Resharper, the location of this setting has changed:
